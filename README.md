# Starter Code Doesn't Match Assignment

Darn... Completing this assignment has been another example of a graded assignment not being explained well. None of the advanced JavaScript used was actually taught by the program we paid over $6,000 for. I had to use JS and HTML module exports/imports and create a package.json to eliminate errors in the dev console. I'm sure there are much better ways to accomplish this, so maybe I'll come back to repo after my course is finished.

Unfortunately, I don't think the recorded videos used to "teach" us are a complete set. The video for this task says things like "you'll remember when we did x, y, z... but we didn't ever do x, y, z! Very strange... and worrisome.

It seems as if the video was talking to a completely different class. I think they're editing and/or omitting videos, therefore giving us less information. Our Modules in their current state are too erratic to honestly be a comprehensive course created and sanctioned by MIT. I have a sneaking suspicion that this course used to be coherent, but has been butchered and spliced beyond recognition.

The README below was included in the starter code. It doesn't match our Codio assignment, and there are also files we don't use. It looks like this Module was butchered and they didn't clean up all the mess. They left these wayward files and outdated README behind.

What they are doing to us is not right. This is not a kind way to teach beginners.

## Boston City Data Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to pick out the top 5 earners in Boston (total salary + overtime) and list them out in the web page as shown below:
Name     Total Earned

Next, pick out the number of people working in the city of Boston who earn over $100,000 and display it on the web page as shown below:
Number of people working in Boston earning over $100,000 is xxxx.

You are given file index1.html which you will need to edit. You can rename it to index.html for convenience. However, if you want to use GitHub Pages to display your README.md then Pages will use your index.html file instead.

You also need to use curl to get the Boston City data from https://pollysnips.s3.amazonaws.com/bostonEmployeeSalaries.json
